# decision_tree

A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm works by creating a tree-like model of decisions, with each internal node representing a "test" on an attribute, each branch representing the outcome of the test, and each leaf node representing a class label or value. The algorithm creates the decision tree by starting from the root node and then recursively splitting the data into branches based on the most important feature, until the tree is fully grown and all leaf nodes contain predicted class labels or values. The final decision tree can then be used to make predictions on new data by simply following the path through the tree that corresponds to the values of the input attributes.

Decision trees are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Here is an example of how you could implement a decision tree in C++
